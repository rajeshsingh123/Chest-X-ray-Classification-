# Chest-X-ray-Classification-
ðŸš€ Project Overview:
Developed an advanced deep learning model using TensorFlow for the classification of chest X-ray images, aiming to distinguish between "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA" cases. This project showcases a comprehensive approach to medical image analysis.

* Dataset and Preprocessing:
   Utilized a substantial dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of 5000 chest X-ray images. Employed meticulous data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality, including 
   normalization, noise reduction, and handling class imbalances.
* Data Augmentation:
   Implemented data augmentation strategies to expand the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and perform effectively on unseen data. Techniques such as rotation, 
   flipping, 
  and zooming were applied to diversify the training set.
* Model Architecture:
  Leveraged state-of-the-art ResNet models for their proven effectiveness in image classification tasks. Configured and fine-tuned the architecture to optimize performance in the 
  specific context of chest X-ray classification.
* Training Process:
  Conducted extensive model training sessions on the augmented dataset, utilizing TensorFlow. Monitored and adjusted hyperparameters to achieve a notable 84% accuracy, indicative of the 
  model's proficiency in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia cases.
* Data Visualization:
  Incorporated comprehensive data visualization techniques using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the distribution of classes, model performance over 
  epochs and potential areas for improvement.
